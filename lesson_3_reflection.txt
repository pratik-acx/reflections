When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    We would need the remote repository setup so we can share our code with others
    or on differnet computers easily as well as for others to contribute to the 
    project we are working on

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    We would want to pull changes manually to our local branch as we wouldn't
    want a change from someone else interfere and break something we have in 
    our local repository or branch.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

    Forks are a github concept of making a clone of an existing repository
    Clones are those which are a copy of an existing remote repository into 
    a local repository, they can also be a copy of an existing local repo
    Branches are just labels given to a commit and there could be multiple
    branches in a given repository. can be seen by git branch

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

    It is good to have a local copy of the remote branch from the last time 
    we ran git clone or git pull. It helps with conflict resolutions when 
    others could be updating the remote branch and also to be able to diff 
    and see what changes have been introduced in the remote and if you want
     to include that or how to merge it and push back your local updates
